Dependency-free version!

`specs2-core` is finally dependency-free and doesn't need to be built for various versions of Scalaz.

## Changes

 * **project** dropped the support for Scala `2.10`
 * **core** removed the dependency on Scalaz, there is now a `specs2-fp` module implementing a small amount of FP concepts
   to support the internal implementation of specs2 itself
 * **scalaz** moved `DisjunctionMatchers` and `ValidationMatchers` to that module
 * **scalaz** dropped the support for scalaz `7.0`
